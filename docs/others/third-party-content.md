Big thanks to all the community who help out with SystemsRx/EcsRx.

## Hey, I want to have my plugin listed too!

Great stuff buddy, all you need to do is add it here in a PR with a link to the plugin (with optional profile link) and a blurb about what the plugin is/does, or if you don't fancy that just raise an issue detailing the above and we can add it for you.

Here is a current list of plugins made by the community for use with SystemsRx.
